# Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is 
# prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is
#  a number that has no divisors.). You can (and should!) use your 
#  answer to Exercise 4 to help you. Take this opportunity to 
#  practice using functions, described below.

num = int(input("Enter a number to see if its prime: "))

# divisors = []
# x = 0
# while x < num:
#     x += 1
#     y = num % x
#     if y== 0:
#         divisors.append(x)
#     else:
#         print(str(x) + " is not a factor of " + str(num))
# print(divisors)
